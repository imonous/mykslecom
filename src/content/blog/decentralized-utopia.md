premise:
1. why must we access so many apps for the SAME service, with merely different data?
2. why is it not YET possible to have centralized uis & uxs? one data ingestion app (maybe split for learning & brainrot). one chat app. what we constantly see in sci-fi (e.g. blackmirror). we have the technology for this, obviously! this is more than a technology problem...
3. obviously, this is due to (sadly true) economic factors. but everything we have is SO clearly against everything we as free nations (US et al) stand for. free speach, lack of monopolies, human freedom & choice...
proposal:
4. split up data & ux. DATA: YouTube videos, X posts, hackernews, etc... UX: TikTok algo (for brainrot), a simple (LLM/AI infused) curator app, etc... some open (& flexible) protocols for DATA providers. allow ads, monetization, everything that we have now. BUT, we will finally have one centralized ui, we will have a CHOICE for data we want to ingest...
past exemplars:
5. Google Reader (RSS, 100M+ userrs). People would use this!
6. RSS tech. ActivityPub? ...

rebutal:
-> how does it fit forums? (spoiler: it does)
